# Object-tracking-robot
This is my ISOC (IEEE Summer of Code) Project. 

##Aim : To create an object tracking robot using a Raspberry-Pi

Due to the lockdown, parts are currently unavailable, so, in order to make do with the product in my possession right now, I tried to control a servo instead. If the object moves to the left of the screen, the servo does so as well and vice versa.

The Reference Code folder contains some extra code which is to be used whenever a new object is to be detected. The colour range can be obtained from here and can be used in the master.py file in the Main folder.
